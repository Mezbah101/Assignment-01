1. Difference between null and undefined :-

undefined occurs when a variable is declared but not assigned a value.

null is assigned by the programmer to indicate “no value”.


2. map() and forEach()

map() creates a new array by applying a function to each element.

forEach() does not return anything; used for performing actions like logging or updating DOM.


3. Difference between == and ===

== (loose equality) compares values after type conversion.

=== (strict equality) compares both value and type.


4. Significance of async/await

Allows writing asynchronous code in a synchronous style.

Simplifies Promise handling and makes code more readable.


5. Concept of Scope in JavaScript

Global Scope → variable accessible anywhere in the code.

Function Scope → variable accessible only inside the function.

Block Scope → variable accessible only inside { } (using let or const).
